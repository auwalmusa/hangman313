## Project Description
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game. This Python implementation randomly selects a word from a list, and the user tries to guess it letter by letter before running out of lives.

## Aim of the Project
- Practice Python basics: loops, conditionals, user input, and OOP (Classes/Methods).
- Learn to manage a project with Git/GitHub and maintain a sound development workflow.
- Implement a fully functional game that can be extended with new features.

## What I Learned
- **Lists and Strings**: Creating a list of underscores for each letter in the secret word.
- **Conditional Logic**: Checking if a guessed letter is valid, already guessed or in the word.
- **Functions and Methods**: Splitting logic into methods like `check_guess` and `ask_for_input`.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Using a `Hangman` class to hold all relevant attributes and behaviours.
- **Git**: Staging, committing, pushing changes, and updating documentation.

## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/auwalmusa/hangman.git
