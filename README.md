## Project Description
A Python-based Hangman game where the program randomly selects a word for the user to guess.  
Users attempt to guess the word one letter at a time, with validation to ensure valid inputs.

## Aim of the Project
- Gain familiarity with Python fundamentals: variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- Practice user input handling and code organization with functions.
- Improve Git/GitHub workflow by committing changes at each milestone.

## What I Learned
- How to store words in a list and randomly select one using the `random` module.
- How to capture user input with `input()` and validate it (`len()`, `str.isalpha()`).
- How to split a program into multiple functions (`check_guess()`, `ask_for_input()`).
- Basics of Git: staging, committing, pushing changes, and merging branches.

## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone** the repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/auwalmusa/hangman313.git
