## Project Description
This is a **Hangman** game implemented in Python. The program randomly selects a word from a list of possible words, and the user attempts to guess it one letter at a time. The user starts with a certain number of lives, and an incorrect guess reduces their remaining lives by one.

## Aim of the Project
- Practice fundamental Python skills (lists, loops, conditionals, functions, OOP).
- Learn how to handle user input and maintain game state in a class-based design.
- Gain experience in using Git/GitHub for version control and documentation.

## What I Learned
- **Random Module**: Selecting a random word via `random.choice()`.
- **Input Validation**: Ensuring guesses are single alphabetical characters.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Creating a `Hangman` class to encapsulate the game logic.
- **Game Flow**: Managing guesses, tracking unique letters, reducing lives, and determining win/loss outcomes.
- **Git and GitHub**: Best practices in committing changes, pushing to remote, branching, and merging.

## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone or Download** the repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/auwalmusa/hangman313.git
